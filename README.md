INDINF02 - INTERCOMMUNICATION (SSI/SPI)

Work in group of 2 and implement a SSI/SPI Master-Slave communication between two TI Tiva C Launchpads. It should be possible to toggle the green and red led on the master with the buttons of the slave device. Don't forget to debounce the buttons and ensure that only if the button is pressed for exactly 2 seconds the led should be toggled.
